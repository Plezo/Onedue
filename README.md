A todo app created to help getting tasks done (for real this time)

The mvp will be a traditional todo list but I eventually plan on
adding a crucial feature that will be the "selling point" which
would be the focus feature.

The focus feature essentially has you pick out the one item
from the list you've created and strictly have you focus on that
one. 

In the context of working on a project, when you want to push
out your MVP, worrying about the small things like having your
site load a second faster is not as much of a concern as having
functional api endpoints. 

This app will consistently make you think about the one thing that
thrusts you forward into achieving your goal(s).
